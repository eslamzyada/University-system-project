# This is a console program that imitate the university system:
it has multiple classes such like: Professor, Student, Subject, Person, Employee, and the main file which include the actual run of the program
the person class is a parent class for Employee, and Student classes, Professor class is a sub class of the Employee one.
by registering as a Student you will be able to register as a new student, or you can search, delete, edit students data, and the list of all students
by registering as a professor you will be able to register as a new professor, or you can search, delete, edit professors data
I still work on the system so i didn't finish the employee part of the system.
